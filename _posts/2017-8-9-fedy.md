Fedy's [GitHub is here](https://github.com/rpmfusion-infra/fedy).

### What's fedy? 

Fedy lets you install multimedia codecs and additional software that Fedora doesn't want to ship, like H264 support, google-chrome, pre-built applications from 3rd part vendors and much more with just a few clicks.

To install and run Fedy in Fedora, run the following command:

```
# RPM Fusion
sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm

# Install fedy copr repository
sudo dnf copr enable kwizart/fedy

# Install fedy
sudo dnf install fedy -y
```

So I think Fedy is a first thing to use after fresh Fedora install.
