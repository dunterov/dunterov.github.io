### What's fedy? 

Fedy is apps&tweaks all-in-one hub, which lets you install multimedia codecs and additional software that Fedora doesnâ€™t want to ship, such as MP3 support, Adobe Flash, Oracle Java, and much more, with just a few clicks.

To install and run Fedy in Fedora, run the following command:
```
sudo sh -c 'curl https://www.folkswithhats.org/installer | bash'
sudo fedy
```
My own top of fedy's apps&tweaks is:

### Apps:
* Skype
* Steam
* TeamViewer
* Telegram
* Vivaldi
* WPS Office - /// Best alternative to MS Office

### Dev Tools:
* PyCharm
* Sublime Text

### Tweaks
* Better font rendering
* Fancy Bash prompt

### Utilities
* All of them =)

So I think Fedy is a first thing to use after fresh Fedora install.
