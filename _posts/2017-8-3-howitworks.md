### Blog on github? What?

Here I want to describe, how that blog works. I've discovered it a couple of days ago, but as I see it's pretty awesome and lightweight.
First, what is GitHub? GitHub is literally a hub, where you can store your source codes using git. More important is that fact, that github become a powerful portal with rich functionality. One function is "Gitbook Pages". It allows you to publish some info using git and standard markup. So, let's see step-by-step how to make a blog like this! Hope, this post will be useful for someone.

Here's an installation's steps:
* Sign Up\In on GitHub
* Go to the [Jekyll-now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/)
* Fork it!
* Rename forked repository just like yourusername.github.io
* after that, edit _config.yml. File's structure is simply enough, so no problem should be appeared.
* After that, go to Settings to check from which branch is site built. If you see something like:
  
> Your GitHub Pages site is currently being built from the master branch.

than all OK. If not - select branch and press "Save"
* Now go to https://yourusername.github.io
* That's it! You're UP&Running!

### Right. So, how to make a post?
