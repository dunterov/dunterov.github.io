My name is Dmitrii Unterov. I'm a DevOps engineer with over 10 years of experience and a Master's degree in Computer Science. I focus on building scalable, automated infrastructure using tools like Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines across AWS and GCP, which helps to drive product delivery and develop processes that improve efficiency and customer value.

My DevOps career began in the fintech world, where I learned the importance of speed and reliability. From there, I moved into the telecom industry, gaining experience at scale, followed by a stint in the video game sector - fast-paced, dynamic, and full of challenges. Eventually, I felt a pull toward making a broader impact and contributing to the academic space. Today, I'm a Senior DevOps Engineer at the University of Cambridge.

This blog is where I (occasionally) share things I've learned, built, or broken along the way.

Why do I write? It's my small way of giving back - contributing to the tech community, open source, and the shared pool of knowledge on the internet.
